# Section 7 : The MPC (Model View Controller)

## What's MVC

Separation of concerns

### Models
- Represent your data in your code
- Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

### Views
- What the users sees
- Decoupled from yout application code

### Controllers ( <-- Routes )
- Connection your Models and your Views
- Contain the "in-between" logic
